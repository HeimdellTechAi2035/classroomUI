# Health & Safety Policy

**Version:** 1.5  
**Last Updated:** February 2024

## Purpose

This policy ensures the health and safety of all participants in RemoteAbility training programmes, with a focus on remote/home working environments.

## Remote Working Environment

### Workspace Setup
- Use a dedicated workspace where possible
- Ensure adequate lighting (natural light is best)
- Position your screen at eye level to reduce strain
- Use a supportive chair with good posture
- Keep your workspace tidy and free of hazards

### Ergonomics
- Take regular breaks every 45-50 minutes
- Practice the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds
- Stretch regularly during breaks
- Adjust screen brightness to match your environment

### Digital Wellbeing
- Minimise screen time outside of sessions where possible
- Use blue light filters in the evening
- Set boundaries between work/training time and personal time
- Practice digital detox when needed

## During Training Sessions

### Taking Breaks
- 10-15 minute break after 45-50 minutes
- Get up and move around
- Rest your eyes
- Get some water

### If You Feel Unwell
- Let your trainer know
- Turn your camera off if needed
- Take a longer break if required
- Don't push through if you're struggling

### Mental Wellbeing
- Training can be challenging - this is normal
- Speak to your trainer if you're feeling overwhelmed
- Use the support request feature if you need help
- Remember: progress, not perfection

## Emergency Procedures

### In Your Home

- Message the trainer when you can
- We can catch you up later
