## Trainer Script

"Right, let's take our 10-minute break now. We've been talking about some quite personal things around confidence and communication.

During this break, I really encourage you to step away from your screen. This isn't just about resting your eyes - it's about giving your mind a chance to process what we've discussed.

Some suggestions for your break:
- Step outside if you can, even for just a few minutes
- Do some gentle stretching
- Make a cup of tea or get some water
- Take a few deep breaths
- Ground yourself - notice what you can see, hear, or feel around you

We'll reconvene at [TIME]. Please be back and ready to continue with our group discussion."
