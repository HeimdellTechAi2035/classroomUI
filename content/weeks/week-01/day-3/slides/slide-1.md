## Activity Overview
**Gentle Activation & Confidence Normalisation**

Welcome everyone to Day 3 of Week 1! Today we're focusing on rebuilding confidence, understanding communication styles, and helping you feel safe using your voice again.

## Trainer Script

"Good morning/afternoon everyone! Welcome to Day 3. 

Today's session is about something really important - your voice and your confidence. I want to start by saying this: confidence is not something you either have or don't have. It's something you rebuild.

Many of us have had experiences that knocked our confidence. That's completely normal and understandable. Today we're going to start the gentle process of rebuilding it."

## Energiser Activity

"For our energiser today, I want everyone to think of one thing you did recently that took effort - no matter how small.

It could be:
- Getting up and joining this session
- Making a phone call you were nervous about
- Asking someone a question
- Trying something new
- Even just getting dressed and facing the day

When you're ready, share that one thing in the chat or unmute and tell us. Remember - no effort is too small to acknowledge."

*Allow 5-6 minutes for sharing*
