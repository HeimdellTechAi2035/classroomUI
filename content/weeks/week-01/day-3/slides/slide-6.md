## Trainer Script

"We're coming to the end of Day 3, and you've all done some really important work today. 

Today we've explored some deeply personal territory - confidence, communication, and finding your voice. These aren't just nice-to-have skills; they're essential for feeling like you belong in work environments.

Let me reinforce our key message: using your voice safely is a skill that can be learned. It's not about becoming someone different - it's about becoming more confidently yourself."

## Key Takeaways

### Today's Big Ideas

1. **Confidence Can Be Rebuilt**
   - It's not fixed - it grows through safety, repetition, and small wins
   - Past experiences that knocked your confidence don't define you
   - Every small effort counts towards rebuilding

2. **Communication Styles Are All Valid**
   - Verbal, written, structured, paced - all have value
   - The goal is finding what works for YOU
   - Different situations might call for different approaches

3. **Your Voice Matters**
   - You have a right to be heard
   - Your thoughts and feelings are valid
   - Respectful communication is something you deserve

4. **Practice Makes It Feel Natural**
   - Safe environments help us try new things
   - Even small practice sessions build confidence
   - Effort matters more than perfect delivery

## Reflection Moment (3 minutes)

"Before we finish, let's take a moment to reflect. You can share in chat or just think quietly:

1. **What's one thing about communication that feels a bit clearer now?**
2. **What's one small thing you might try differently tomorrow?**
3. **How are you feeling about your own voice right now?**

*Allow time for responses*

"Thank you for sharing those thoughts. I can see real insights happening here."

## Looking Ahead to Day 4

### Next Session Preview
"Tomorrow we're going to build on today's foundation. We'll be focusing on:

- **Expectations** - What's realistic to expect from yourself and others
- **Boundaries** - How to set and maintain healthy limits
- **Pacing** - Finding a sustainable rhythm for your energy and capacity

These topics connect directly to what we've discussed today about confidence and communication."

### Between Now and Next Session
"I'd like to invite you to try one small thing:

**Notice your communication** - Just observe when you feel comfortable expressing yourself and when you don't. No pressure to change anything, just gentle awareness.

**Be kind to yourself** - If you catch yourself being self-critical about communication, try to speak to yourself like you would a good friend."

Remember:
- Your voice matters
- You deserve to be heard respectfully  
- Communication confidence grows with practice and support
- You're exactly where you need to be in this journey

See you tomorrow for Day 4. Have a gentle rest of your day."
