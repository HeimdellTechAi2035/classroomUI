"Now we're going to have a discussion about finding your voice. This is really personal territory, so please share only what feels comfortable.

We're going to explore some questions together. You can respond in chat, speak up, or just listen - all forms of participation are valuable.

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers here. We're all learning about ourselves and each other."
