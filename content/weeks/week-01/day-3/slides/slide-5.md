## Trainer Script

"Now we're going to do some gentle practice. This is about building confidence through doing, but in a completely safe way.

We're going to practice expressing simple work-related statements. These are the kinds of things that might feel difficult in a real workplace but are completely reasonable and necessary.

The beautiful thing about this exercise is that YOU choose how to communicate. You can write it, speak it, type it in chat, or even just think it through. There's no wrong way to do this.

Remember: I'm going to praise your effort, not judge the delivery. The goal is practice, not perfection."

### Scenario B: Setting a Boundary
