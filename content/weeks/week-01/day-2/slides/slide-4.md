# Slide 4: Group Discussion - Experiences & Concerns
**Time: 25 minutes**

## Discussion Prompts
Choose questions that feel right for the group:

- What worries you about assessments?
- What has gone wrong with assessments in the past?
- What support helps you learn best?
- What would make assessments feel safer for you?

## ⚠️ Safeguarding Notes

- Validate all feelings and concerns
- Watch for signs of distress
- Follow up privately if needed

## Facilitation Tips
- Normalize anxiety about assessments
- Share that many people have had bad experiences
- Emphasize that this will be different
- Focus on support rather than testing
