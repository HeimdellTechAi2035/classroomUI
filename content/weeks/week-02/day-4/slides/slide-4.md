# Week 2 Day 4 Slide 4: Time Management Challenges Discussion
**Time: 25 minutes**

## Discussion Topics

### Common Time Management Challenges
Share experiences with these typical workplace situations:

**Challenge 1**: Constant interruptions throughout the day
**Challenge 2**: Multiple urgent deadlines at once
**Challenge 3**: Procrastination on important but not urgent tasks
**Challenge 4**: Email and communication overload
**Challenge 5**: Meetings that seem unproductive
**Challenge 6**: Difficulty estimating how long tasks will take

### Personal Challenge Sharing
- What's your biggest time management challenge? (from break reflection)
- What have you tried before?
- What worked, what didn't work?
- What stops you from being more organized?

### Solution Brainstorming
For each challenge discussed:
- Which of the four pillars (Planning, Organization, Task Management, Boundaries) would help most?
- What specific strategies might work?
- What would need to change to implement these strategies?

## Facilitation Approach
- Start with pairs, then small groups, then whole group sharing
- Encourage practical, realistic suggestions
- Validate that these challenges are universal
- Focus on small, achievable improvements

## Learning Focus
- Normalize common time management struggles
- Generate peer solutions and support
- Apply framework to real situations
- Build community around shared challenges

## Trainer Notes
- Be ready with additional strategies if discussion needs support
- Acknowledge different work environments and constraints
- Keep discussion practical rather than theoretical
