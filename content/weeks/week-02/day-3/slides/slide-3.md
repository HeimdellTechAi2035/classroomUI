# Week 2 Day 3 Slide 3: Break Time
**Time: 10 minutes**

## Purpose
Provide mental break and processing time for problem-solving concepts.

## Instructions for Learners
- Take a proper break from learning
- Refresh drinks/snacks
- Step outside or move around if possible
- Chat informally with others

## Trainer Actions
- Set clear return time
- Be available for individual questions
- Prepare materials for group discussion
- Check in with any learners who seem overwhelmed

## Break Activity (Optional)
Think of one problem you've solved recently - could be work, home, or personal. We'll briefly share after break.

## Environment Check
- Ensure comfort (temperature, seating)
- Check technology is working for next activity
- Tidy presentation space
- Review learner engagement levels

## Timing Note
Return promptly after 10 minutes to maintain momentum and schedule.

## Accessibility Considerations
Some learners may need longer to process new concepts - be flexible with individual needs while maintaining group schedule.
